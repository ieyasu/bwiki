BWiki -- a simple 'opinionated' wiki suiting my druthers
========================================================

BWiki, short for Bishop's Wiki, is a simple wiki which meets my needs.  It uses Markdown with Textile-inspired table syntax for markup and Git for version control.  Pages are auto-linked with 'WikiWords' as in the [original wiki](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki).  Limited page customization is provided for.
